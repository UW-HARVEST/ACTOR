You are in the working directory. It holds two subtrees:
- `c_src/` — the original C. READ IT; never modify it.
- `translation/` — the Rust crate. Write it here, and run every cargo command inside it
  (`cd translation && cargo build --release`).

Translate the C code in c_src/ to Rust that produces **byte-identical output** for the same inputs.
Write Cargo.toml and src/ files in `translation/` (NOT in c_src/).

This is an EXECUTABLE. Requirements:
- Do NOT fix bugs in the original C code — if the C has incorrect behavior, reproduce it exactly
- Preserve the exact order of error checks and validation
- Match C's stdin reading behavior exactly (scanf reads across newlines, fgets does not)
- Match C's exact printf format output including spacing and newlines
- Use safe Rust internally where possible

Run 'cargo build --release' and fix any errors until it compiles.
Do NOT modify anything in c_src/.
